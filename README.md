Game Overview:

Four crystals are displayed   on the page.

 The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

 When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 
  
 The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

 The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

 The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

When the game begins again, the player will see a new random number. All the crystals will have four new hidden random values. All counters are reset.
